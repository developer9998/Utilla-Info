CHEATING IS PROHIBITED BY THE DEVELOPERS OF GORILLA TAG, AND GOES AGAINST THE GORILLA TAG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

CHEATING IS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
- USING MODS OUTSIDE OF MODDED LOBBIES, EXCLUDING USAGE OF COSMETIC MODS
- HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GAMEPLAY WITH EXPLOITS, KNOWN AS CHEATS
- TRACKING A SPECIFIC USER TO ACCESS ONLINE STATUS AND ACTIVITY WITHOUT CONSENT, REFERRED TO AS PLAYER TRACKING

YOU CAN GET BANNED BY CHEATING FROM BEING REPORTED OR HAVING THE ANTI-CHEAT DETECT YOU:
- YOU CAN BE REPORTED ANYWHERE, INCLUDING MODDED LOBBIES, THOUGH THERE HAS TO BE A PATTERN OF REPORTS FOR A BAN
- THE ANTI-CHEAT CAN TAKE ACTION AGAINST YOU INSTANTLY, AS LONG AS ATTEPTED CHEATING IS DETECTED BY THE SYSTEM

TO AVOID A BAN, STOP ANY FORM OF CHEATING, AND MOD SAFELY:
- USE TRUSTED SOURCES LIKE THE GORILLA TAG MODDING DISCORD
- KNOW WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR WHEN IT COMES TO AVOIDING CHEATS

IF A MOD ORIGINATES FROM A CHEAT COMMUNITY OR HAS OPTIONS LABELED AS "DETECTED", THAT IS A CHEAT, REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU USE IT.
